x4-diagrams
===========

Diagrams illustrating [X4] faction relationships and economy flows.

This project is entirely unaffiliated with Egosoft.

Usage
-----

```shell
python -m x4 --help
python -m x4.factions
python -m x4.economy
```

Graphviz `dot` files will be written to an `output/` directory.

Notes
-----

I've used [Economy Flow Charts - X4 Foundations Wiki] as the reference for grouping wares into "tiers". The only change I've made was to move Scanning Arrays from tier 5 to tier 4, which made several diagrams much simpler.
